Backs up an honour save file whenever a save happens in Baldur's Gate 3. 

Run concurrently when playing the game to backup.

Currently, it only works with honour mode.

Run with:
```
function test() {
  console.log("python ./main.py");
}
```
Select a save on the first load.

To select a new save to monitor:
```
function test() {
  console.log("python ./main.py --reselect");
}
```
